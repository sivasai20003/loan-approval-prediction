# Loan Approval Prediction Project

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to predict loan approval decisions using applicant demographics, financial information, and credit history. It demonstrates end-to-end data science skills from data cleaning to model deployment.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handle missing values and outliers
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Comprehensive visualization of patterns
- **Feature Engineering**: Create meaningful predictive features
- **Machine Learning**: Compare Logistic Regression vs Random Forest
- **Business Insights**: Actionable recommendations for lending decisions

## 📊 Results
- **Best Model**: Logistic Regression
- **Accuracy**: 87.5%
- **Key Predictors**: Credit History, Loan Amount, Applicant Income

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Machine Learning**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn
- **Data Processing**: Feature engineering, encoding, scaling
